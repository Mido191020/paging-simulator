# Project Roadmap

This repository follows a progressive complexity curve:

- **[M3] Linear Demand Paging:** Basic translation and page fault handling.
- **[M4] Multi-Level Paging:** Implementing hierarchical page tables to reduce memory overhead.
- **[M5] Generic N-Level Paging:** A generalized solution supporting arbitrary tree depths.
- **[M6] Inverted Page Table:** Advanced hashing techniques for mapping frames directly.
