# M2 — Big Page Table (Realistic Paging)

Objective:
Move from identity mapping to a real page table with
arbitrary virtual → physical frame mappings.

Key ideas:
- Physical memory is limited
- Page table lookup replaces identity logic
- Debuggable translation path
- Error handling for invalid pages

M2 ends where real OS problems begin.
