# Paging Simulator

An educational OS project for understanding virtual memory and paging,
built incrementally like a real operating system.

## Project Structure
- Code written incrementally per milestone.
- **Archived Milestones:** Completed milestones are archived in their own folders for reference.

## Milestones
- ✅ **M1: Basic Paging** (Identity Mapping) - *Completed*
- ✅ **M2: Big Page Table** (Linear Paging) - *Completed*
- ✅ **[M3: Linear Demand Paging & RAM](./M3_Linear_Demand_Paging)** - *Completed (Includes Physical Memory & Page Fault Handler)*
- 🚧 **M4: Multi-Level Page Tables** - *In Progress*
- ⚡ **M5: TLB Simulation** - *Planned*
- M6 — Web Visualization (Future Work) Status: Concept Only
Goal:
-Provide an interactive visualization of the virtual memory system
-to improve debugging, learning, and intuition.
-Not required for completion.

## Philosophy
- OS-first thinking
- No shortcuts
- Debuggable and explainable
