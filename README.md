# Paging Simulator

An educational OS project for understanding virtual memory and paging,
built incrementally like a real operating system.

## Project Structure
- Code written incrementally per milestone.
- **Archived Milestones:** Completed milestones are archived in their own folders for reference.

## Milestones
- ✅ **M1: Basic Paging** (Identity Mapping) - *Completed*
- ✅ **M2: Big Page Table** (Linear Paging) - *Completed*
- ✅ **[M3: Linear Demand Paging & RAM](./M3_Linear_Demand_Paging)** - *Completed (Includes Physical Memory & Page Fault Handler)*
- ✅ **[M4: Multi-Level Page Tables](./M4_MultiLevel_Paging)** - *Completed (Includes Directory/Table Hierarchy & Visualizer)*
- ⚡ **M5: TLB Simulation** - *Planned*
- 🌐 **M6: Web Visualization** - *Concept Only (Future Work)*
  - *Goal: Interactive visualization to improve debugging and intuition.*

## Philosophy
- OS-first thinking
- No shortcuts
- Debuggable and explainable
